      <p class="question">
        What makes HestaBit different from other development companies?
        <i class="fa-solid fa-circle-chevron-right"></i>
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        What sets us apart is our philosophy we believe that an idea and a
        product are not the same. The idea is the core engine, and the product
        is the technology that brings it to life. We work closely with founders
        to create products that are technically sound, user-centric, and built
        to scale. Our apps have been recognized at Cannes Lions, featured in
        FWA, and have generated millions in PR but what matters most to us is
        the impact our work creates for our clients.
